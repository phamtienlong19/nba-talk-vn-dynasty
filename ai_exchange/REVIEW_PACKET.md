## Issues
None. Visual review (desktop + mobile) was run this session via headless
Playwright screenshots — see `ai_exchange/IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## Decisions Required

- Cameron Carr and Labaron Philon Jr. were reviewed per the correction
  pack's instruction but do not clear the CAP-first top 60 naturally
  (no Yahoo rank, $0 cap, no forced-inclusion guarantee for these two
  specifically) -- excluded. Flagging in case the owner wants either
  force-included the way the other 16 curated names are; that's a one-line
  change to `GUARANTEED_NAMES` in `scripts/build_fa_draft_pool.py`.

## Suggested Next Step
Open/update the PR from `feat/final-keeper-freeze` if not already done, then request human/ChatGPT review of this packet.
