# yahoo-roto

Roto points, raw category totals and an all-play matrix for any **publicly viewable, head-to-head** Yahoo fantasy league, from its league id. Python 3
standard library only, read-only, no sign-in. It does not depend on the rest of this repository.

## Quick use
```bash
python3 yahoo_roto.py 85092                          # text table: season roto (every week with stats)
python3 yahoo_roto.py 85092 --week 3                 # one week; --through 3 = weeks 1-3; --json for machine-readable
python3 yahoo_roto.py 85092 --report out/            # out/index.html (self-contained, opens anywhere) + out/report.json
python3 yahoo_roto.py 85092 --report out/ --png      # + out/roto.png, raw.png, allplay.png (needs Google Chrome / Chromium)
python3 yahoo_roto.py 85092 --report out/ --cache .cache   # reruns only fetch the newest week
```
`index.html` has tabs Roto | Raw stats | All-play and a Season / Week N selector; it is mobile-first (team column sticks, wide tables scroll inside
their own card, no page-wide sideways scroll). The PNGs are drawn from the same page at device scale 2.5 (720 px / 720 px / 1040 px wide), sized to their
content. Set `$CHROME` if Chrome is not found. Fonts (Inter, Roboto Mono) come from Google Fonts; offline, system fonts are used.

## A public link that refreshes itself on game days
Needs one separate public repo (you create it; for example `yahoo-roto`) with GitHub Pages on:
1. Put `yahoo_roto.py`, `report.html` (as `index.html` or beside it) and `leagues.json` in the repo; copy `roto-live.yml` to `.github/workflows/`.
2. Run the "Roto live" workflow once (Actions tab, optional league id). It loops about 115 minutes per run (every ~4 min on game hours, 15 min otherwise),
   queues its own successor (GitHub drops many cron triggers), and force-pushes `<league>/report.json` to an orphan `data` branch.
3. Share `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/report.html?league=<id>&repo=<owner>/<repo>`. The page re-fetches the JSON every 2 minutes while visible and
   says "data is N min old" if the feed stalls. Add `&me=<teamId>` to outline your team, `&view=allplay&week=3` to deep-link.

About 8 Yahoo requests per league per refresh (only the newest week; finished weeks are cached), 1.5 s apart. Keep `leagues.json` small.

## How roto is computed
Per category, teams are ranked (worst = 1 point, best = number of teams, level teams share the average place, fewer is better for TO/PF). Season roto adds
the weekly totals first; percentages come from summed makes and attempts. All-play: every team against every other, category by category. All of it is
derived here and display-only: not a Yahoo number. A week is final once a later week has stats; the newest week is "in progress".

## Limits (stated, not hidden)
- The league must be viewable without a login. A private or unknown id gets a plain message; the tool never signs in and cannot read it.
- Head-to-head leagues only (weekly matchup pages). A roto-scoring league has no weekly pages and is refused, not guessed.
- Counting categories and made/attempted percentages are computed; ratio categories (ERA, WHIP ...) are listed and skipped.
- Verified on one league (NBA, 9 categories): week-1 roto and all-play equal this repo's own tested code for all 16 teams (`tests/test_yahoo_roto_tool.py`).
  Other leagues and sports are untested.

Tests (no network): `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` here; the repo's suite runs them too.
